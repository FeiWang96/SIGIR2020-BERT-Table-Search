As for SADIE, plus magnetic drum (6k words) Mark 1 1970 Sales Order processing Architecture similar to the Data General \"NOVA\" in that the memory and I/O highways were separate whereas DEC used a common highway for memory and I/O with the peripherals occupying memory addresses. The NOVA was a 16 bit design but the Molecular was 18 bit allowing signed arithmetic and a memory parity check bit. The instruction set was in some ways similar to the Nova. The M18 was designed by a small team headed by Colin Chapman & Ian Miller. Operating system known as LOS developed by Joe Templeman in Leicester office of Systemation. Programming was done in octal notation machine code in longhand using coding sheets. The 17 bit word allowed the limited storage of 3 bytes per word using \"Metacode\" [Disk_storage|disk drive] Mark 2 1973 Sales Order Processing Totally new processor with hardware interrupt stacking, a variable cycle time and new disc controller.

[Control_Data_Corporation|CDC] Mark 3   Designation not used but was effectively the 3ME/6ME which was a MK2 processor modified to run the MK1 OS and application software.

Developed after the demise of BCL by ABS computers. Basically a 6ME in a new cabinet with lead acid battery backed static RAM instead of ferrite core. Programming still done in octal notation machine code in longhand using coding sheets. CDC Hawk Mark 5 1984 SOP, Livestock Markets, Paper merchants, Plumbers merchants. Basically a re engineering of the 6ME processor to remove redundant stack logic and reduced to 3 boards with a printed circuit backplane instead of the costly wire wrapped backplane used for earlier models.

Many Jains do not return Jainism as their religion on census forms for various reasons such as certain Jain castes considering themselves both Hindu and Jain. Following a major advertising campaign urging Jains to register as such, the 1981 Census of India returned 3.19 million Jains. This was estimated at the time to still be half the true number. The 2001 Census of India had 8.4 million Jains.

Although Zoey treasures Chase's opinion, Chase had heard the rumor before Zoey gets a chance to tell him about the news. This leads Chase to bitterly convince Zoey that she should go to London, and she decides to leave PCA. After she leaves, Chase starts hanging out with a disgusting girl named Gretchen who looks a lot like Zoey. He later admits that he only did so because he missed Zoey. In a cliffhanger ending, due to a webcam malfunction, Zoey watches Chase confess his love for her when talking to Michael and Logan. Zoey's parents come for an unexpected visit to PCA and tell Zoey and Dustin that they are moving to England because Zoey's dad's business is starting a new branch in London. When offered to accompany the parents to London, Dustin quickly declines the offer because he is seeing someone, but Zoey decides to think about it first.
