Opal is left unable to move after her battle with D. Fisher and is nearly killed by Vaiz's brother Voiz, but it rescued by a newly energized Gear, who joins the siege on the fortress. Tejirov leaves to prevent Bays from interfering with Gear, leaving Opal in Nel's care, but Vaiz surrenders, remarking that the battle is already lost. In the end, Segua takes Hope Fortress, and Gear is given the nickname of \"Blue Sonic\", becoming infamous throughout both the Ninteldo empires and their allied countries. Gear finds out that General Alex is his father, but cannot rescue him because of the wound Alex got in the cell. Tejirov tells Gear that he must instead absorb Alex. He refuses at first, but Alex said says he has no choice and forces Gear to touch him. Before he is absorbed, he tells Gear the story of his mother, the only killer Alex considered to be his equal, whom he had to absorb after they were so badly wounded in combat that they could only survive if one of them absorbed the other.

She became anorexic in high school and dropped out of college after one semester. She began binging and purging shortly after. She went to an inpatient treatment center and was in recovery for a year, but then relapsed and has been on a downward spiral ever since. Her bulimia has caused major health problems and friction between her and her family members. Amy has stolen from her family and been caught shoplifting food multiple times. Her parents have moved to a new house to accommodate Amy's disorder, allowing her to live in the basement but locking her out of the main house to prevent her from stealing their groceries. Amy consumes an average of 24,000 calories a day and is obsessed with exercise and burning calories. Her family hopes that an intervention will save her from slowly killing herself. Amy accepted the offer of treatment and completed three months at Remuda Ranch, where she did not always cooperate in her recovery but ultimately gained weight. After being transferred to an extended care facility, she was discharged after twelve days for noncompliance. In keeping with the rules they set out at the intervention, her parents did not allow her to continue living with them, so she went to stay with a friend and was still binging and purging as of this episode's airing.
